## Project Description
This is a dark theme based animated website built using set of libraries like swiperJS, locomotiveJS, GSAP ScrollTrigger and more.

## Issues I Faced and How I Resolved Them

While developing this website, I faced an issue where LocomotiveJS hijacks the scroll functionality of the entire application, preventing other scroll events from working. After researching the problem, I found an article with a code snippet that helped me fix the issue.
